# Remote desktop connectivity

DeviceLink WSS remains the authorized signaling/control transport. WebRTC media
and its input channel use ICE, with the existing JPEG path retained when video
cannot connect. File transfer reuses the ICE configuration through an independent
data-only connection; object storage remains its fallback (see below).

## ICE configuration

Each viewer attempt requests `GET /api/device-link/ice-servers` from its authenticated
device-link service. The controlled Desktop independently requests that same API
while preparing its capture window. API credentials stay in Main / native Mobile;
only short-term TURN allocation credentials cross the dedicated capture/WebView
bridge. These scoped WebRTC credentials cannot authorize desktop input or invoke
business APIs. They are never embedded in static HTML, persisted or logged.

Response: `{iceServers: [{urls: string[], username: string, credential: string}],
expiresAt: string | null}`. At most four entries and four STUN/TURN URLs per entry;
URL scheme/length/ports and credential lifetime are checked before bridge delivery.
Require two minutes of remaining lifetime for cold capture/SDP/ICE headroom.
The owning backend supplies its deployment's node pool; no new user region setting.

Missing endpoint, empty configuration, invalid response and a three-second timeout
fall back to the old public STUN list. With a valid self-hosted list, public STUN
is not added. All configured nodes participate in ICE checks; a dead first node
does not prevent using candidates from the others. URI ordering is not a promise
of priority. Candidate statistics already distinguish direct, relay and JPEG paths.

Every existing bounded media retry fetches fresh configuration on both peers.
No configuration cache, WSS reconnect or new global retry loop. The WebView bounds
its native bridge wait at 3.5 seconds. Lease/generation/attempt checks reject stale
responses; explicit stop takes precedence. A failed media attempt affects only its
owner. Credential expiry may require rebuilding the connection; this change does
not promise uninterrupted in-place renewal of TURN allocations.

Old clients continue unchanged. New viewer + old Desktop can still use viewer-side
TURN; old viewer + new Desktop can use host-side TURN. Existing full-SDP and trickle
ICE capabilities stay unchanged. The desktop-video connectivity change adds no new wire kinds or native dependencies.
The independent file transport below has its own authorized IPC channel.

## Verification

Unit tests cover invalid/expired tickets, old/disabled backends, bounded requests,
fresh credentials/backup lists on retries, and stop/late-response isolation.
The Server repository contains the coturn deployment template and matching API
contract (`docs/device-link-server.md`, `infra/turn/README.md`).

For a real relay test, store an authenticated API response in a task-specific
temporary directory outside this repository (mode 0600), then run:

```sh
node scripts/remote-desktop-turn-smoke.mjs /absolute/external/ice-config.json /absolute/path/to/chrome
```

The probe uses an isolated sandboxed browser, forces relay on both peers, checks
16 KiB data round-trip and the selected relay pair for each TURN URL, then repeats
with an unreachable first node. Output excludes URLs, IPs, credentials and SDP.
Delete the temporary credential file after use. This operator probe makes real
network requests and is intentionally excluded from unit tests.

Local test evidence for this change: coturn 4.18.0, two loopback nodes, real Chrome,
UDP/TCP for both nodes and unreachable-primary case passed. Separately, coturn's
client verified a temporary test CA and received 40 TLS-relayed messages using the
deployment template with loopback-only test overrides. This proves TURN data flow
with the Server credential algorithm; it does not prove platform UI behavior,
publicly trusted browser TLS, the Linux container deployment, or Mainland China reachability.
For rollout, repeat on the deployed nodes and real Desktop/Mobile with trusted TLS,
node failure, >1-hour sessions, two viewers and network switching. Compare STUN-only
versus configured TURN on identical network pairs, recording sample count,
connection success, first moving frame time, selected path, RTT and recovery time.

## QA handoff

Before external QA, deploy the matching ICE API to the test environment and inject
its TURN node configuration through deployment secrets. Distribute Desktop and
Mobile builds from this change that use that environment. Both devices must use
the same account/session realm. A loopback proxy or an inspector-only endpoint
override on a developer machine is not a usable QA environment. Keep login realm
discovery intact; Desktop local-server mode pins both realms to the local manifest
and is unsuitable for testing production enterprise SSO across realms.

On 2026-09-09, a macOS Desktop and an iOS simulator on the same machine displayed
real desktop video and delivered a pointer movement to the expected OS position.
With a separately hosted public coturn node, forced UDP relay and TCP relay with
an unreachable first candidate server connected. Closing an established media
connection recovered via UDP relay in approximately 16 seconds. The deployed ACL
was corrected to omit `denied-peer-ip=::`, which coturn interprets as an unbounded
range; coturn already rejects unspecified peers before its ACL checks.

These are functional probes, not a network-quality acceptance result. A direct
sample had 1 ms RTT and a UDP-relay sample had 84 ms RTT; neither is an average or
end-to-end input latency. Receiver loss and jitter were not collected. Publicly
trusted TLS, Linux Compose, physical phones, Windows/Android, concurrent viewers,
active-node failover, and hour-long sessions still need QA coverage.

For each network pair, record client versions, session realm, transport, attempts,
successes, first moving frame time, RTT p50/p95, receiver packet-loss deltas, jitter,
frame rate/freezes and recovery duration. Distinguish connection recovery from
initial selection of a reachable backup, and RTT from input-to-visible-response
latency. Test the previous STUN-only behavior on the same pairs. Include JPEG and
object-storage transfer regression checks; do not report unavailable metrics as zero.

## Remote files and HTML previews

`device-link:file-peer` is an allowlisted DeviceLink RPC, with a 30-second request
budget and versioned `caps`, `offer`, `open`, `close` actions. Signaling keeps the
existing account, enabled-host and controller-revocation checks. It introduces no
relay envelope kind or server file API. Both peers use the existing ICE endpoint;
ICE chooses a direct or TURN path. The file channel does not share desktop video,
input handling, capture permissions or capture-process lifetime.

File access has two layers. `packages/device-link/src/fileAccess.ts` owns the
shared directory/text operation facade and whole-file transfer selection; Desktop
and Mobile adapters provide platform I/O. Sidebar downloads, message files/media,
Mobile export/share and requested HTML resources use this policy. Directory listing
keeps the existing `remote-op` and separates complete enumeration from display
filtering. Bounded text previews retain binary detection, truncation and gzip;
they are preview projections rather than whole-file downloads.

Whole-file reads request `prepareOnly` after host authorization. Up to 64 KiB,
including empty files, returns inline bytes; larger files attempt the reusable
file WebRTC connection, then OSS. The peer limit is 2 GiB; range-streaming
media intentionally use OSS, selected before downloading any peer bytes. Workdir
downloads probe `caps.fileRead` first: old hosts retain two-phase export jobs, so
large uploads do not regress to a single relay invocation. `fileUrl` resolves a
workdir-relative reference on the host, never guesses nested SSH as local storage.
Nested SSH whole-file export remains unsupported as before; media URLs with an
explicit verified SSH session retain their existing SSH materialization path.

Mobile uses a separate trusted WebView with a
build-time-generated script (`node scripts/file-peer-runtime.mjs`), never native
`Function.toString()`. User HTML receives no native file or transport bridge.
Missing peer capability, connection or transfer failure falls back to OSS; explicit
cancellation/account change cancels the operation instead. Old hosts remain usable
through OSS, but the direct file path requires an updated host.

Transport errors do not bypass host authorization. Cancelled/obsolete reads do
not start fallback or deliver completed results; disposable peer files are released.
Legacy OSS export jobs and shared cache fills may finish in the background after
a consumer leaves. They do not tear down another consumer's transfer or the relay.
Directory/text/index caches and file-download identities include account/device
scope; unscoped Mobile v1 directory/snippet caches are not read. Preview snapshots
still own their copied files independently from the short-lived transfer staging.

An `open` request resolves the same authorized media URL as OSS. Only Main resolves
paths, checks the effective size limit and opens the descriptor. The renderer sees
an opaque one-use ticket. Files are limited to 2 GiB, transferred in 16 KiB blocks
with at most 16 outstanding blocks, and checked for exact size, offsets and source
stat changes through EOF. This is not a persistent content-hash cache. Changed files
fail and follow the existing fallback behavior. Each source and sink rechecks its
connection owner; revoking one controller closes only that controller's transfers.
Reads queue per Desktop peer and per Mobile file connection; a busy channel alone does
not cause an OSS fallback. Queued cancellation skips that read without interrupting its
predecessor. Connections are bounded, reusable for sequential files and expire after 60 seconds
idle. Mobile staging has a 4 GiB aggregate cap and a five-minute lifetime; consumers
copy into their existing cache/preview ownership. Backgrounding cancels in-flight
work, but completed files retain their normal lifetime. Account changes remove them.

Local Desktop HTML opens directly with `file://` in the sidebar or system browser,
following the existing opening preference. It does not enumerate or copy its parent
directory. Remote HTML uses a viewer-local loopback HTTP server. Each browser request
stats/reads only the requested resource through existing file access; no directory
listing, total file-count or aggregate directory-size check precedes opening.
Resources are transferred as whole files before responding, not HTTP range streams.
The preview layer has no separate 100 MiB resource cap; missing or failed resources fail
individually while the page remains usable. Reloads may observe changed source files;
there is no atomic directory snapshot. Relative resources stay within the entry's
parent directory; hidden paths are excluded and realpath checks prevent symlink
escape outside that root.
This does not execute a remote site's backend.
Desktop retains at most eight active previews; a new open evicts the oldest when
full. External tab closure is not observable. An evicted page must be reopened;
the two-hour expiry and concurrent preparation bound still apply. Each HTTP response
owns its staging files, cleaned after response completion. Shared cache fills may
complete after a preview closes without cancelling other consumers.
Desktop and Mobile share the snapshot CSP and parser-first device API guard in
`maker-shared/file-preview`. UTF-8 `.html`/`.htm` pages receive the guard; Desktop also
serves the CSP as a response header. Other encodings and XML documents (XHTML/SVG) preserve their MIME
and bytes, receive the response policy, and do not receive an HTML script prolog.
Same-origin assets and requests remain usable,
while external subresources, fetch and forms are blocked. The
snapshot policy also explicitly denies workers, preventing Service Worker registration
from surviving a temporary loopback origin. This is not a zero-egress
sandbox: documents without the prolog and the shared guard's residual child realms can access WebRTC, and an
external browser's top-level navigation is outside the loopback server's control.
Mobile uses native request/response callbacks for on-demand resources. The legacy
`start(files)` API remains available, and JS on older native binaries retains the
previous directory-snapshot behavior and limits. On-demand loading requires a new
iOS/Android native build; the WebRTC transport itself reuses the existing WebView dependency.

Validation entrypoints: `node scripts/file-peer-smoke.mjs <Chrome executable>`
checks the shipped WebView script over a real local WebRTC connection, including
empty/block-boundary files, sequential reuse and sink failures. Protocol, Main
permission/descriptor and Mobile staging tests cover bounded failure paths. This
local browser probe does not establish deployed TURN, physical phone, network
switching or release-build acceptance; test those separately with matching accounts
and record versions and the actual selected path.

Large-file transport retains protocol version 1 and advertises optional `caps.maxBytes`.
Old peers keep their previous limits and rejected peer reads retain the existing OSS fallback.
Both receivers reserve disk space for the incoming file and its consumer copy plus 256 MiB
headroom; preview copies and Mobile OSS downloads also check disk headroom. WebRTC receive
commands use a 60-second deadline renewed by successful disk writes rather than a ten-minute
total deadline. Mobile on-demand HTTP requests allow up to two hours including queueing,
transfer and response consumption; cancellation/backgrounding still closes them immediately.
This does not add Range streaming or make very large HTML document parsing memory-bounded.
