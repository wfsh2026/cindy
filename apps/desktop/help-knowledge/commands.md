title: Slash commands
summary: Type "/" in the composer to open a palette merging your skills, built-in app commands, and the agent's own commands.
---
Type `/` at the start of the composer to open the command palette.

**What's in the palette (priority order on collisions):**

1. **Your installed skills** (highest priority) — anything in your global or project skills directory (see the Skills topic).
2. **Built-in app commands** — `/help` (show available commands), `/clear` (clear the current session context — resets the conversation in place without creating a new session), `/cmd` (run a shell command in the working directory), `/issue` (file an issue), `/goal` (start a goal-driven run), `/learn`, `/workflows`, and `/jump-session`.
3. **The agent's own commands** — e.g. `/compact`, `/agents`, `/memory` (the exact list depends on the agent; Claude Code and Codex each contribute their own).

`/issue` does not require a GitHub plugin or GitHub account. The confirmation card uses Cartethyia's official bot by default; if a working account is already configured under **Plugins > Cindy GitHub**, that account appears as an optional submission identity.

Before submitting, Cartethyia helps clarify missing details so the issue is actionable. For bugs, it can collect reproduction steps and user-approved, redacted diagnostic summaries; the confirmation card always shows the final public content. After creation, Cartethyia returns the issue link and can help interested users reproduce or fix the problem from source because Cartethyia is open source.

**Using the palette:**

- Start typing to filter. Matching is **contains-based** (case-insensitive substring matching on the command name) — not fuzzy.
- Up to 25 matches shown at a time.
- **↑ / ↓** move focus, **Enter** runs the focused command, **Esc** closes the palette.

**Notes:**

- If a name collides across sources (same command in a skill and in a built-in), the higher-priority source wins; the lower-priority one is silently skipped (logged as a warning).
- Most built-in app commands run inside the desktop app (a few, like `/workflows` and `/jump-session`, are handled directly in the UI); agent commands are sent as prompt prefixes to the agent.
