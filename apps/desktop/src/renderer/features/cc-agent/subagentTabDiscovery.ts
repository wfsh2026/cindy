/**
 * Subagent tab discovery — "does this task own a durable Subagent tab?".
 *
 * Registration is a one-shot goal, not a subscription: once the tab exists the
 * panel itself owns every later read (local change pushes / its own 1s remote
 * poll). So this watcher stops as soon as it registers.
 *
 * `onPresenceChange` is the exception. The tab's *visibility* cannot be one-shot
 * the way its registration is: a task that started durable children under Pi and
 * then switched to Claude Code / Codex still owns them, so the entry has to stay
 * — and once the records are gone (`/clear`, a rewind past their start, parent
 * deletion) it has to go away again. Falling edges therefore keep watching past
 * registration: the local path keeps its change subscription, and the remote
 * path — which has no change push at all — drops to a much slower poll rather
 * than stopping. Without a presence consumer both stop at registration, exactly
 * as before.
 *
 * Two data paths, one contract:
 *  - local task  → local DB read + `subagentRuns.onChanged` push.
 *  - remote task → the durable truth lives on the data-owning device, so the
 *    read goes through device-link. There is no remote change push for this
 *    channel, so a low-frequency poll fills in. It is deliberately 5s-scale:
 *    the only thing it can discover is "a tab should exist", and the panel's
 *    own faster poll takes over the moment it does.
